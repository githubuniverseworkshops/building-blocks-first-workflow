# First Action

## Purpose

This is an example JavaScript project with tests.

`createObject(obj)` strips out keys of `obj` whose values are `undefined` or empty strings.

In the [Building Blocks: Creating your own GitHub Actions with JavaScript](https://githubuniverse.com/workshops/#building-blocks-58-creating-your-own-github-actions-with-javascript) workshop, we'll add a workflow to run the Jest tests.
